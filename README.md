# Stock-Market-AI
Working on a Time-Series project that predicts the upcoming trends in Share Market

# Stock Market Analysis Project

This repository contains a stock market analysis project conducted using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project was primarily developed in Google Colab and includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization tasks for 50 Unique companies.

## Project Overview

The project involves analyzing stock market data for multiple companies. The dataset includes information about various companies' stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant metrics. The main objectives of the project are:

- Clean and preprocess the raw data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations.
- Identify patterns and trends in the stock market data.
- Prepare the data for machine learning models.

## Files Included

1. **Stock_Market.ipynb**: This Google_Colab Notebook file contains the main analysis code. It includes Python code blocks for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Each code block is accompanied by detailed instructions for reference.

2. **Stock_pre_ML.ipynb**: This Google_Colab Notebook file contains code for preparing the data for machine learning models. It includes the selection of relevant columns from the cleaned data and any necessary preprocessing steps.

## Dataset Details

The dataset used in this project consists of stock market data for 50 unique companies. It contains the following columns:

- 1 categorical column
- 1 datetime column
- 7 numeric columns
- 120842 rows
